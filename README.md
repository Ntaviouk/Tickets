ANNOTATION
    The aim of the Railway Tickets project was to develop a software product that would enable users to book railway tickets conveniently and efficiently.
The application is implemented in the C# programming language, using the Windows Forms framework to create the user interface.
The development process consisted of the following steps:
- At the initial stage, a process model was created to systematise the programme and define the necessary classes and their relationships based on the principles of object-oriented programming;
- The next step was to create a visual layout of the interface, which included all the necessary functionality for convenient user interaction;
- The project implementation included the actual creation of a software product based on the developed models, interface and functionality, as well as testing its operation.
    The result of the project is a software product that automates the purchase of railway tickets, demonstrates the use of modern approaches to software development, and meets the requirements of clean code and Solid principles.
